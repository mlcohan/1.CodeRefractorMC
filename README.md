Homework 1: due 12/19

    add title "Horiseon" to give the webtab a name

    add id= to search-engine-optimization to fix broken link

    add alt to <img> tags and deleted an unnecessary </img>

    created classes= "benefit-subset" and "content-subset" in HTML to consolidate the css






question, the id tag makes page drop to different place?
